// Swap Force's "Nightmare from the start" (games/swapforce/docs/history.md, "Nightmare difficulty") [SwapForce].
//
// The difficulty menu (sub_82C12BC0, asked for each of its four rows) offers Easy, Medium and Hard always and Nightmare
// when the slot's property "nightmare_difficulty_unlocked" is 1; the story's end sets it (the script function
// tryUnlockNightmareDifficultyLevel_Internal). sub_829CC788 reads that property and answers whether it is 1: it is the
// check's only source, so answering 1 while the option is on opens the row and leaves the save as it is (nothing writes the
// property: the answer is not stored anywhere), and with the option off the game's own answer comes back.
